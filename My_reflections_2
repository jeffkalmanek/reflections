My reflections 2
Q - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A - it creates a repository and starts tracking the files.
Q - How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A - the staging area contains the files that will be committed.  The value it offers is to control which files are part of the logical change.
